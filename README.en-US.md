## Motivation :thought_balloon:

I played Alien: Isolation for the first time in 2020 and it was a very pleasant experience. It is a very tense and immersive game, but it has its problems, mainly in the dubbing and translation into Portuguese.

This mod aims to correct these problems to make the player's experience even more immersive. The drastic variation in the volume of the dialogs has been fixed, which in my opinion was the worst defect in the Portuguese version of the game. **To check in detail all the content enhanced by the mod [click here](./src/mod-content.md)**.
